<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Variable manufacturing overhead</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify">Manufacturing overhead can be broken into 2 types – <b>fixed manufacturing overhead</b> and <b>variable manufacturing overhead</b>.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Fixed manufacturing overhead costs incur every accounting period regardless of product quantities you manufacture.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Variable manufacturing overhead strictly depends on the number of units produced and reflects some costs that can be entirely assigned to the total batch of product or service – for example the cost of batch transportation, batch custom duties, batch shipment cost, the cost of electricity to produce a batch, water, lubricates or, for example, some outsourced service or cost.</p>
