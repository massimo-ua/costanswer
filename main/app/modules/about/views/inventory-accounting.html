	<p class="main__text">Because <b>COSTANSWER</b> is not ERP or accounting software, we do not support <b>Perpetual Inventory</b> accounting. This means you don’t have to record constant changes in inventory as they occur according to receipts in either quantity or quality and value.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>COSTANSWER</b> uses the <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting method to compute the value of inventory and the cost of goods sold. The average cost is based on the total “cost of goods available for sale” for the entire accounting period (one month or one year). The average cost per unit is then applied to the units in inventory and to the units that have been sold.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Using the weighted average approach means that the recorded amount of inventory represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased into stock. Similarly, the cost of goods sold will reflect a cost between the oldest and the newest units that were sold during the basic accounting period – one month.</p>
	<p class="main__text">For you, as a system user, all this means that you would have to enter input forms for raw materials or working hour rate with an average value of these costs per month.</p>
	<p class="main__text">The <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting approach is allowed under both US GAAP and IFRS worldwide accounting standards.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>COSTANSWER</b> uses the month as the basic accounting period to record and track changes in inventory, sales revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit. You can easily create a 12-month manufacturing forecast or an actual budget to track all of your production activities.</p>
