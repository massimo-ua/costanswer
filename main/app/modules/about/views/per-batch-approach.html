<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>“Per Month” or “Per Batch” approach</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTASWER</b> allows you to enter raw-materials and labor-hour values using either “Per Month” or “Per Batch” approach.</p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you know that you need 800 square feet of denim to manufacture a “batch” of 45 jeans. And it takes 2 days to make that quantity.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Or you can know that in order to manufacture 1400 pairs of jeans per month you need 2600 square feet of denim.</p> 
<p class="text-justify">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at entering-the-data stage corresponding to the <b>standard volume</b> of purchased and assigned raw materials, applied labor hours and manufacturing overhead.</p>
<p class="text-justify">We admit that in some cases it’s more convenient to “assemble” the cost of the product using “per unit” approach. You can easily achieve that if you simply consider 1 unit as a batch of units at entering-the-data stage.</p>
