<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Process costing</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Process costing</b> means that there are 1, 2 or more different technological processes (or departments) that produce one product or deliver the same service. It can be used for mass production of many identical products, for example, the production of canned meat, soda bottles, beer, tins of paint and so on.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Process costing</b> is a pretty rare costing choice for small business. Usually this method is used by big and medium manufacturing plants.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Also many service companies that specialize in performing repetitive, routine aspects of a particular business use <b>process costing</b>. For example, professional accounting or legal firms that often focus on repetitive aspects of basic tax practices or routine legal services.</p> 
<p class="text-justify">This method can also be used for cost calculation of products or even services that require labor or materials outsourced to other companies. In this case the outsourced cost can be one of the “processes”, required for completion of goods or services.</p>
<p class="text-justify">There are two distinguishable features of <b>process costing</b>:</p>
<ol class="quick-start">
    <li>All the products (services) in a process are identical and indistinguishable from each other. And usually they are manufactured continuously (non-stop) 24/7 without stopping production lines (conveyors).</li>
    <li>The output of one process forms the material input of the next process.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-justify">The details of process costs and units are recorded in a process account which shows (in very general terms) the <b>direct materials</b>, <b>direct labor</b> and <b>manufacturing overheads</b> as part of the process and materials output at the end of the process.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/img1.png"></p>
<p class="text-justify">Process costs are allocated to units of production on the basis of <b>equivalent units</b>.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The idea behind <b>equivalent units</b> is that a partly-processed unit can be expressed as a proportion of a fully-completed unit. For example, if 10 units are exactly in a mid-way of the production process, they are effectively equal to 5 fully-completed units. Therefore the 10 partly-processed units can be regarded equivalent to 5 fully-completed units or 5 <b>equivalent units</b>.</p>
<p class="text-justify">For most processes the <b>direct materials</b> are input at the <b>start</b> (!) of the process (<b>100 %</b>>), so only adding the cost of <b>direct labor</b> and overheads will be <b>incomplete</b> at the end of the period.</p>
<p class="text-justify">This means that the material cost should be spread over all units, but conversion costs (labor + overheads) should be distributed over <b>equivalent units</b>.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Equivalent units</b> measure the work done during the period, expressed in fully completed units. Companies use this measurement to determine the cost per unit of a finished product.</p>
<p class="text-justify">WIP and fully-completed units transferred out of a process can be valued on different bases: <b>weighted average method</b> and the <b>FIFO</b> (first-in-first-out) method.</p>
<p class="text-justify">First method of computing <b>equivalent units</b> is referred to as the weighted-average method. It considers the degree of completion (weighting) of the units completed and transferred out, and the end of work in process.</p>
<p class="text-justify">With <b>FIFO</b>, started WIP units are distinguished from units that began later on in the period, assuming that the started WIP units are completed first.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> provides <b>process costing</b> calculations using <b>weighted-average metho</b>.</p>
<p class="text-justify">As far as the final objective of calculations, the result is going to be a tangible product or delivered service. <b>COSTANSWER</b> approach to this method implies the creation of  “Product/service” which includes 1, 2, 3 and more processes as part of the product/service costing analysis.</p>
