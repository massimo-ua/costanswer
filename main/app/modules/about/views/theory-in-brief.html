	<h2 class="main__title">The theory, in brief</h2>
	<p class="main__text"><b>COSTANSWER</b> online cost accounting and budgeting software was created and designed to help small and medium-sized businesses determine and understand the true costs of their products or services.</p>
	<p class="main__text">What are product costs? Costs incurred in the process of acquiring or manufacturing a product that can be apportioned to the product are considered product costs. Product costs are considered variable costs, because they change along with the volume of production.</p>
	<p class="main__text">All costs that do not have a direct relation to the creation of a product and cannot be assigned to a product are called <b>period</b> costs and charged as an expense.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Period expenses can be a part of business management (sales commissions, marketing, advertising and administrative expenses), financing (loan repayments) and investment (purchase of necessary equipment). These expenses do not belong to cost of goods manufactured (sold), and you cannot add them to the cost of your products or services.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Also, period costs are called that because they should match revenue, in accordance with the matching principle in accounting, so these types of costs are charged in the accounting period in which they are incurred.</p>
	<p class="main__text">We admit that most of us subconsciously tend to think that all possible costs and expenses must be added to the final cost of the product. And we, at <a href="www.costanswer.com" target="_blank" class="_ornge_cor">www.costanswer.com</a>, cannot forbid you to add, for example, period expenses to your product’s cost while using our online software. However, you should know that when it comes to monthly financial reporting your accountant will exclude period expenses from the cost of goods manufactured or sold. Period expenses are reported separately on the Income Statement Report according to both U.S. GAAP and IFRS worldwide accounting standards.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Product costs can have 3 <b>elements</b>:</p>
	<ul class="quick-start">
		<li><b>Direct Materials</b> – raw materials or various tangible components</li>
		<li><b>Direct Labor</b> – cost of labor used during production</li>
		<li><b>Manufacturing Overhead (MOH)</b> – a certain allocated (distributed) portion of indirect manufacturing costs</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor">Manufacturing overhead can be additionally broken into 2 types – <b>fixed manufacturing overhead</b> and <b>variable manufacturing overhead</b>.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Under different costing systems, product cost is also different, as in <b>Absorption Costing</b>, where both manufacturing overhead costs and direct materials and direct labor costs are considered as product costs.</p>
	<p class="main__text">On the other hand, in <b>Direct Costing</b> (Marginal Costing) only direct materials and direct labor costs are regarded as product costs, excluding manufacturing overhead.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>COSTANSWER</b> uses an <b>Absorption Costing</b> system in compliance with both U.S. GAAP and IFRS worldwide accounting standards.</p>
