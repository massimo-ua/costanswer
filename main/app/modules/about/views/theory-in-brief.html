<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Theory in brief</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> online cost accounting and budgeting software was created and designed to help small and medium-sized businesses to determine, understand and find the true cost of your products or services.</p>
<p class="text-justify">What are product costs? Costs incurred in the process of acquiring or manufacturing a product and can be apportioned to the product are considered product costs. Product costs are considered the variable costs because they change with the change in volume level of production.</p>
<p class="text-justify">All costs that do not have a direct relation to creation of product and cannot be assigned to the product are called <b>period</b> costs and charged as an expense.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Period expenses can be a part of business management (sales commissions, marketing, advertising and administrative expenses), financial (loan repayments) and investment (purchase of necessary equipment) activities. These expenses do not belong to cost of goods manufactured (sold) and you CANNOT add them to the cost of your products or services.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Also, period costs are called “period” because they should match the revenue in accordance with the matching principle in accounting and therefore, these types of costs are charged in the accounting period in which they are incurred.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Product cost (cost per unit or per batch) can have 3 <b>elements</b>:</p>
<ul class="quick-start">
    <li><b>Direct Materials</b> – raw materials or various tangible components assigned</li>
    <li><b>Direct Labor</b> – cost of labor applied during production</li>
    <li><b>Manufacturing Overhead (MOH)</b> – certain allocated (distributed) portion of indirect manufacturing cost.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-justify">Manufacturing overhead can be additionally broken into 2 types – <b>fixed manufacturing overhead</b> and <b>variable manufacturing overhead</b>.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Under different costing system, product cost is also different, as in <b>Absorption Costing</b> both manufacturing overhead costs and direct materials and direct labor costs are considered as product cost.</p>
<p class="text-justify">On the other hand, in <b>Direct Costing</b> (Marginal Costing) only direct materials and direct labor costs are regarded as product cost excluding manufacturing overhead.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using <b>Absorption</b> Costing system into compliance with both US GAAP and IFRS worldwide accounting systems.</p>
