<p class="text-justify"><b>Standard costing</b> is more suitable for organizations with mass production of homogeneous products or repetitive assembly working cycle. The large volume of mass production allows the average consumption of raw materials and direct labor to be determined.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Setting the technological “standard” is very important for many types of businesses. Let's imagine one simple example - you have a bakery. And every day you are baking 20 kinds of cookies and sweets. Your "recipe" for each type of bakery product is made up of a “standard” amount of raw materials and components, labor time and portion of manufacturing overhead. And you follow it precisely. If you make even one small change in your dough mixture, your batch of croissants will come out of the oven all wrong. You will be faced with loosing time and money.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Of course “standards” (recipes) can be revised and changed. And companies do it from time to time for many reasons.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Standard costs are usually associated with a manufacturing company's costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The key feature of this method is as follows - rather than assigning the actual costs to a product, many manufacturers assign the <b>expected (standard)</b> cost. It means that amounts of manufacturer's inventories and cost of goods sold will reflect the <b>standard</b>, not the <b>actual (!)</b> costs of a product. But manufacturers, of course, still have to pay the actual costs. As a result, differences between the actual costs and the standard costs occur very often, and can be evaluated under <b>Variance Analysis</b>.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Standard costing</b> and the related <b>Variance Analysis</b> can be used to measure the difference between actual and expected sales or to review the performance of both revenue and expenses.</p>
<p class="text-justify">But. There is one problem with this method – both US GAAP and IFRS worldwide accounting systems require an entity to report the <b>actual cost (!)</b> incurred when reporting expenses.</p>
<p class="text-justify">These rules bring up a contradiction to a standard costing application where management  typically uses standard instead of actual costs.</p>
<p class="text-justify">But, as long as these variances are recorded by an accountant, differences between actual and standard costs get accounted for, you can use standard costing and still be in compliance with both US GAAP and IFRS.</p>
