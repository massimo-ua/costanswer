	<h2 class="main__title">Standard costing</h2>
	<p class="main__text"><b>Standard costing</b> is more suitable for organizations with mass production of similar products or a repetitive assembly cycle. The high volume of mass production allows the average consumption of raw materials and direct labor to be determined.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor">Setting the technological “standard” is very important for many types of businesses. Let's imagine one simple example - you have a bakery. And every day you bake 20 kinds of cookies and sweets. Your recipe for each product is made up of a standard amount of raw materials and components, labor time and portion of manufacturing overhead. And you follow it precisely. If you make even one small change in your dough mixture, your batch of croissants will come out of the oven all wrong. You will lose time and money.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Of course standards (recipes) can be revised and changed. And companies do this from time to time for many reasons.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Standard costs are usually associated with a manufacturing company's costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.</p>
	<p class="main__text">The key feature of this method is as follows - rather than assigning the actual costs to a product, many manufacturers assign the <b>expected (standard)</b> cost. This means that amounts of manufacturer's inventories and cost of goods sold will reflect the <b>standard</b>, not the <b>actual</b> (!) costs of a product. But manufacturers, of course, still have to pay the actual costs. As a result, differences between actual costs and standard costs occur very often, and they can be evaluated using <b>Variance Analysis</b>.</p>
	<p class="main__text"><b>Standard costing</b> and the related <b>Variance Analysis</b> can be used to measure the difference between actual and expected sales or to review the performance of both revenue and expenses.</p>
	<p class="main__text">But there is one problem with this method – both US GAAP and IFRS worldwide accounting standards require an entity to report the <b>actual cost</b> (!) incurred when reporting expenses.</p>
	<p class="main__text">These rules create problems for a standard costing application where management typically uses standard instead of actual costs.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor">But as long as these variances are recorded by an accountant, the differences between actual and standard costs are accounted for, and you can use standard costing and still be in compliance with both US GAAP and IFRS.</p>
