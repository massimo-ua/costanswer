<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> has 2 time modes – <b>forecast</b> to assist in manufacturing plans and <b>actual</b> – to track the actual costs incurred during the time period.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Every action in both time modes is called <b>“project”</b> and can be recorded and opened as a saved set of data.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Using the <b>forecast</b> mode you can receive data of total quantity and cost of raw materials and labor, markup, sales revenue and gross profit per each product or service you plan to produce or deliver.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Using the <b>actual</b> mode you can track product or service cost, sales revenue and gross profit, actual cost and amount of direct materials and direct labor that were purchased and assigned to a product or a service during that period.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Of course, you can use <b>actual</b> mode for planning as well <b>forecast</b> mode. It will require more time to enter data required, but your reports will become way more precise regarding quantities and costs of raw materials, labor, overheads, revenues and gross profits.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Variance analysis</b> allows you to compare project's and product's total values.</p>
