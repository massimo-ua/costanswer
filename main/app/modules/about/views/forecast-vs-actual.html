	<h2 class="main__title">Forecast vs actual</h2>
	<p class="main__text"><b>COSTANSWER</b> has 2 time modes – <b>forecast</b>, to assist in manufacturing plans, and actual, to track the actual costs incurred during a period.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor">Every action in both time modes is called a <b>“project”</b> and can be recorded and opened as a saved set of data.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Using the <b>forecast</b> mode you can receive data on the total quantity and cost of raw materials and labor, markup, sales revenue and gross profit for each product or service you plan to produce or deliver.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Using the <b>actual</b> mode you can track the product or service cost, sales revenue and gross profit, actual cost and amount of direct materials and direct labor that were purchased and assigned to a product or a service during that period.</p>
	<p class="main__text">Of course, you can use <b>actual</b> mode for planning as well as <b>forecast</b> mode. It will require more time to enter the required data, but your reports will become much more precise regarding quantities and costs of raw materials, labor, overheads, revenues and gross profits.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>Variance analysis</b> allows you to compare a project's and a product's total values.</p>
