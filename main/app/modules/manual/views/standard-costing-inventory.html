		<p class="main__text">This item reflects the quantity of finished goods available in your storage or warehouse at the beginning of the accounting period – the first month of your project. This amount does not have direct impact on the cost of the product.</p> 
		<p class="main__text">It refers to company's current inventory assets valuation in the <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) schedule</b>. Inventory assets are: WIP, raw materials and finished goods. The <b>COGM schedule</b> is a very helpful managerial tool. It reports and adjusts the total manufacturing costs for the accounting period (month, year) in the work‐in‐process inventory account to calculate the cost of goods manufactured.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The amount of the <b>COGM</b> is transferred to the finished goods inventory account during the accounting period and is used to calculate the cost of goods sold on the <b>Income Statement Report</b>. When comparing the accounting of several <b>Income Statement Reports</b> over time, you can track the changes of your gross profit volumes. This helps you set future goals and strategies for sales, inventory and overhead.</p>
