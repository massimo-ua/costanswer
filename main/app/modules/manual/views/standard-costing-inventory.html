<p class="text-justify">This element reflects the quantity of the finished goods available at your storage at the beginning of the accounting period – the first month of your project. This value does not have direct impact on the cost of the product.</p>
<p class="text-justify">It refers to company's current inventory assets valuation in the <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) schedule.</b> Inventory assets are: WIP, raw materials and finished goods. The <b>COGM schedule</b> is a very helpful managerial tool. It reports and adjusts the total manufacturing costs for the accounting period (month, year) in the work-in-process inventory account to calculate the cost of goods manufactured.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of the <b>COGM</b> is transferred to the finished goods inventory account during the accounting period and is used to calculate cost of goods sold on the <b>Income Statement Report</b>. When comparing the accounting of several <b>Income Statement Reports</b> over time, you can track changes of your gross profit volumes. This helps you set future goals and strategies for sales, inventory and overhead.</p>

<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting method to compute the value of inventory. It means that the recorded amount of inventory represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased, manufactured or sold. In other words, the cost valuation of the finished goods in stock by the end of the month depends on the average monthly cost per product.</p>
