	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text"><b>WIP (work-in-proсess) ending</b> inventory is the sum of all the costs put into the production process to manufacture products that are partially completed at the end of the accounting period (month). It can be expressed both in currency and quantity.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you have some partially completed products at the end of the forecasted accounting period you have to somehow define its quantity and find their average value in an unfinished condition.</p>
		<p class="main__text">WIP ending has a direct impact on the product cost under the <b>COSTANSWER</b> standard cost method in accordance with the formula shown below:</p>
		<img src="/assets/formula3.png" alt="" class="main__formula _width_cor">
		<p class="main__text">where:</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>DM $</b> - is the cost of direct materials assigned</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>DL $</b> - is the cost of direct labor applied</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>VMOH $</b> - is the cost of variable manufacturing overhead applied</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>FMOH $</b> - is the cost of fixed manufacturing overhead apportioned</p>
	</div>
	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">Usually, under the standard cost method WIP at the beginning of the month has the same standard currency value and quantity as WIP at the end of the month. However, if you start the production of a new product, the number of partially completed products at the end of the first few forecasted months can be higher than the quantity at the end of the forecasted year due to the lack of personnel experience and competency, higher purchasing cost of direct materials and smaller output and sales of the finished goods manufactured.</p>
		<p class="main__text">Also, WIP refers to the company's current inventory assets valuation and its value should be included in the <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) schedule</b>. This <b>schedule</b> is a very helpful managerial tool. It reports and adjusts the total manufacturing costs for the accounting period (month, year) in the work‐in‐process inventory account to calculate the cost of goods manufactured.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The amount of <b>COGM</b> is transferred to the finished goods inventory account during the accounting period and is used to calculate cost of goods sold on the <b>Income Statement Report</b>. When comparing the accounting of several <b>Income Statement Reports</b> over time, you can track changes of your gross profit amounts. This helps you set future goals and strategies for sales, inventory and overhead.</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">Here is a simple example to understand the importance of inventory valuation. You have purchased 1000 sq. feet of denim to produce jeans, store it and start accounting it for the value of the raw materials. After you pulled it for production of jeans, it’s no longer accounted for within materials inventory. Once your jeans are finished, they are accounted for in the value of finished product inventory. During the interim, jeans are valued and accounted separately as the work-in-process (beginning or ending). Conclusion – every raw material is an asset and must be valued and accounted for during all stages of transformation into the finished product during the production cycle.</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting method to compute the value of inventory. It means that the recorded amount of inventory represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased, manufactured or sold.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you are unsure what to enter for WIP value you can consult your accountant, or simply avoid entering any data at this stage, put “0” and press the “Save” button.</p>
		<p class="main__text">Return to this section when you finish entering other values of the product and see the final costs per unit and per batch. Then you can start entering different data of WIP ending inventory to understand its impact on the product cost.</p>
		<p class="main__text">There are many different methods of WIP ending and beginning inventory calculations. Some of them are based on subjective visual estimate. Some require usage of special measurement devices or even laboratory analysis.</p>

	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">For example, you can use the simple and proved method of equivalent units calculation. Assume that you planned to manufacture 230 wooden chairs during July but the real quantity of the finished goods has reached 200 units because 30 chairs were left in WIP ending inventory in an unfinished condition. Your subjective estimate is that these chairs are 70 percent complete. 30 chairs multiplied by 70 percent equals 21 equivalent units. Add that to the 200 completed units to determine your total equivalent units produced:</p>
		<p class="main__text _center_cor">200 + 21 = 221</p>
		<p class="main__text">Divide the cost per batch for the period by the total number of equivalent units produced to determine your cost per unit. For example, according to product costing report, the cost per batch of 200 wooden chairs in July is 10,000 dollars. The cost per equivalent unit will be:</p>
		<p class="main__text _center_cor">$10,000 / 221 = $45.25 </p>
		<p class="main__text">Multiply the cost per unit by the equivalent units sitting in work-in-process inventory at the end of the period to calculate the value of WIP ending inventory:</p>
		<p class="main__text _center_cor">$45.25 x 21 = $950.23</p>
		<p class="main__text">The good news is that NOT ALL products can be partially completed. For example, in the food processing industry or in restaurant business it is hardly possible to imagine a pot of soup in unfinished condition at the end of the month. Also, many businesses with rapid production of goods usually do not track WIP ending, or beginning, inventory.</p>

	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>Important note:</b> Keep in mind, that service is intangible, so it cannot be stored. That is why it is impossible to have its WIP ending inventory value at the end or beginning of the accounting period.</p>
