<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Direct labor</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify">Direct labor is the amount of effort exerted by employees to convert raw materials into finished goods. In other words, it’s the employees’ work that goes into making the products a manufacturer sells. This work can be traced back directly to the products they help to produce.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b><u>Data input</u></b></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Name of worker/title”</b> is a text input field. There is a certain restriction on the length of the name. Please, try to be to be laconic in your statements.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Standard quantity of hours”</b> is the <b>standard quantity</b> of working hours per product’s batch, performed by particular employee. Depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>, this input field corresponds to the <b>standard volume</b> of working hours required either for <b>“Standard quantity per batch”</b> approach:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.5.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">or <b>“Standard quantity per month”</b> approach:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.4.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you know that you need 10 working hours to manufacture a batch of 45 jeans of XL size. It’s a standard quantity of hours required and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch) of jeans. All together you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.2.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.5.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.5.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.6.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">On the other hand, if you choose <b>“per month”</b> approach you should know that in order to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month, you need 150 working hours. It’s a standard quantity working hours required. And it takes a month to make that number of jeans:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.8.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.5.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.7.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.8.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at entering-the-data stage corresponding to the <b>standard volume</b> of assigned working hours.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The number of working hours entered using <b>“per batch”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard quantity required per each month of the annual budget of direct labor of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.9.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">The number of working hours entered using <b>“per month”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard quantity required for the rest of 11 months of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">As you can see on the screenshots the standard quantity of working hours mathematically is the same per each month of the annual budget of direct labor however the example was based upon two different approaches. It’s just a matter of your convenience and your costing methodology.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The number of working hours used during product’s production has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Hourly rate”</b> input field corresponds to the average working hourly rate during the first month of the project. In other words you are setting the average working hour price level at the start of the project. This value has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b> “Payroll taxes”</b> input field corresponds to the taxes imposed on the employer and are usually calculated as a percentage of the salaries that the employer pays the employees when the total salary bill of the employee exceeds a threshold amount. The payroll taxes rates and thresholds vary between states and territories.</p>
<p class="text-justify">In our case we require entering the currency value of projected taxes of particular employee either <b>“per batch”</b> or <b>”per month”</b> depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”.</b></p>
<p class="text-justify">The proportions of taxes amount used during the first month of the project will be calculated automatically for the rest 11 months of the project respectively to the production plan numbers per each month you have entered before.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Annual growth rate”</b> input field corresponds to the change in the hourly rate value over the period of a year. That change will be expressed in the slow and proportioned rise of hourly rate starting from the second month of the project.</p>
<p class="text-justify">When you are done with texts and values, please, press button “Save”.</p>
<p class="text-justify">You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it and, after changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note:</b> please, keep in mind, that usually working month consists of 22-23 working days and the number of working hours per day usually does not exceed 8 hours. That means that the maximum possible legally protected number of working hours per month cannot exceed 170-180 hours.</p>
