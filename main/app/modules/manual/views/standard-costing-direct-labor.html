		<p class="main__text">Direct labor is the amount of effort exerted by employees to convert raw materials into finished goods. In other words, it’s the employees’ work that goes into making the products that a manufacturer sells. This work can be traced back directly to the products they help to produce.</p>

		<p class="main__text"><b>“Name of worker/title”</b> is a text field. There are restrictions on this field’s length; please be brief.</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>“Standard quantity of hours”</b> is the <b>standard quantity</b> of working hours per product’s batch, as performed by a particular employee. Depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>, this field is the <b>standard volume</b> of working hours required either for the <b>“Standard quantity per batch”</b> approach:</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">For example, you know that you need 10 working hours to manufacture a batch of 45 jeans of XL size. It’s a standard quantity of hours required and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch) of jeans. In total, you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year.</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">On the other hand, if you choose the <b>“per month”</b> approach you should know that to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month, you need 150 working hours.

		<p class="main__text">As you can see on the screenshots the standard quantity of working hours mathematically is the same for each month of the annual budget of direct labor; however, the example was based upon two different approaches. It’s just a matter of choice and your cost methodology.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The number of working hours used during a product’s production has a crucial, direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
	</div>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Hourly rate”</b> field is the average working hourly rate during the first month of the project. In other words, you are setting the average working hour price-level at the start of the project. This value has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
	<p class="main__text"><b>“Payroll taxes”</b> field is the tax, imposed on the employer and are usually calculated as a percentage of the salaries that the employer pays on behalf of the employees until the total salary bill of the employee exceeds a threshold amount. The payroll tax rates and thresholds vary between states and territories.</p>
	<p class="main__text">In our case, we require entering the currency value of projected tax of a particular employee either <b>“per batch”</b> or <b>”per month”</b> depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>.</p>
	<p class="main__text">The proportions of tax amounts used during the first month of the project will be calculated automatically for the remaining 11 months of the project with respect to the production plan numbers for each month that you have entered before.</p>
	<p class="main__text"><b>“Annual growth rate”</b> field is the change in the hourly rate value over the period of one year. That change will be expressed in the slow and proportioned rise of hourly rate starting from the second month of the project.</p>
	<p class="main__text">When you are done entering this amount, press the “Save” button.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>Important note:</b> Keep in mind that a usual working month consists of 22-23 working days and the number of working hours per day does not usually exceed 8 hours. That means that the maximum possible number of working hours per month cannot exceed 170-180 hours, without the costs of overtime.</p>
