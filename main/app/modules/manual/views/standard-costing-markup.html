<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Markup</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify"> Markup is the difference between the cost to produce and market an item for sale, and the retail price that is charged for that item. Usually, the mark up is expressed as fixed percentage, and is determined by applying that percentage to the actual cost of the item.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> One of the key advantages of <b>COSTANSWER</b> software is a great and unique option to instantly model product’s markup impact on project revenue and gross margin.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> <b><u>Data input</u></b></p>
<p class="text-justify"> Please, enter the appropriate product’s markup rate for each month of the project.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Then, please, enter the rate of value added tax (VAT). Value added tax is used in many countries outside the USA. We included VAT in the input form for special purpose to remind non-US based small businessmen about necessity to include VAT on the price tags of their products if you are registered in the VAT Register of their countries.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> There are different methods of sales taxation in various states and various countries in the world. For the moment there are two commonly accepted taxes associated with retail consumption – sales tax (USA) and VAT (Europe and other countries).</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Sales tax is charged on the retail sales of tangible personal property unless exempted by law. It’s collected on retail sales at the time of the sale to the final consumer, and only the final sale in the supply chain is subject to tax.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> VAT, on the other hand, is imposed at each stage of the supply chain and ultimately charged in full to the final purchaser. Credits apply to tax paid on the inputs used throughout the supply chain. VAT is generally imposed on sales of goods and services.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Both taxes are indirect taxes so taxpayers must collect and pay them to the government in accordance with the locally imposed tax paying calendar.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Put “0” for VAT if you do not have this tax.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> When you are done with markup rates and VAT value, please, press button “Save”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it, and, after the changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> <b>Important note: </b>please, keep in mind, that VAT is included in the price that the consumer pays in accordance to the price tag he (she) sees in the store. Often VAT is simply invisible to the purchaser. Sales tax, on the other hand, is separately stated on the receipt (invoice) to the customer and the price you see on the price tag does not include sales tax.</p>
