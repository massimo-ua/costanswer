	<p class="main__text">This item reflects the number of finished goods or services to be sold during each accounting period. These values do not have direct impact on the cost of the product but have a direct relation to the financial results of your project via the section <b>“Project revenue”</b> of the project’s <b>Income statement report</b>.</p>

	<p class="main__text">Please, enter the quantity of finished goods or services to be sold during each accounting period (month).</p>
	<p class="main__text">When you are done entering this amount, press the “Save” button.</p>
	<p class="main__text">You can change a saved item by clicking on it. After the changes are done, press the “Update” button.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>Important note:</b> Keep in mind, that you must take into account the number of finished goods starting at the beginning of each accounting period and number of finished goods finishing at the end of each accounting period. The mathematical rule is simple: you cannot sell more than you have in stock at the beginning of the accounting period. When you break this rule, the system will show you a warning message.</p>
