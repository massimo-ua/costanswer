<p class="text-justify"><b><u>Data input</u></b></p>

<p class="text-justify">You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it and, after the changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note:</b> please, keep in mind, that you have to take into account the volume of finished goods beginning at the beginning of each accounting period and volume of finished goods ending at the end of each accounting period. The mathematical rule is simple – you cannot sell more than you have in stock at the beginning of the accounting period. In case you break this rule the system will show you the warning message.</p>
