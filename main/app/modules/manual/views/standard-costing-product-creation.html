<p class="text-justify">After pressing <b>“Standard costing”</b> button, its color changes to green and you will see empty <b>“Product/Service settings”</b> input form of your first product or service.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/14.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">Only “Product/Service name” and “Measurement unit” input fields are mandatory for data to be entered.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Please, pay special attention to the input field    <b>“Standard quantity per:”</b> where you have to choose the type of batch you are going to make your further computations. There are 2 options available – <b>“per month”</b> or <b>“per batch”</b> approach.</p>

<p class="text-justify">What is the difference? It’s just a matter of your convenience and your costing methodology.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Some users are ready to enter the <b>standard volume</b> of assigned direct materials and applied direct labor hours required to manufacture a <b>standard monthly quantity</b> of the product. Other users feel more comfortable to operate with the <b>standard volume</b> of assigned direct materials and applied direct labor hours required to manufacture a <b>standard number</b> of products per certain batch.</p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you know that you need 800 square feet of denim to manufacture a batch of 45 jeans. It’s a standard quantity of denim required and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch) of jeans. All together you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.7.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">If you choose “per month” approach you should know that in order to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month you need 12000 square feet of denim. It’s a standard quantity of denim required. And it takes a month to make that number of jeans:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.1.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at entering-the-data stage corresponding to the <b>standard volume</b> of purchased and assigned raw materials, applied labor hours and manufacturing overhead.</p>
<p class="text-justify">After pressing the button “Save” you will create the new product or service. It will be automatically recorded and stored on our secured cloud-based server as part of your current project. The button with the name is the visual expression of each created product or service.</p>
<p class="text-justify">You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it and, after the changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
