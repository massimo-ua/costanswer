		<p class="main__text">The amount of raw materials used during a product’s production has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>

	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Price per unit”</b> field is the current average purchasing price during the first month of the project. In other words, you are setting 100% of the price level at the start of the project.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The purchasing cost of the raw material used during the product’s production has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
		<p class="main__text">Price values must be free of taxes such as sales tax or VAT.</p>

	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Seasonal price change”</b> field helps you to model price changes expressed in percent – rise or decline - during the year. When forecast the drop of the purchasing price, you must enter the value with negative.</p>
		<p class="main__text">For example, April is the first month of your project. Its purchasing price is 100%. If you project 2% price growth in May, you enter “2” in the seasonal price change field. That will mean that price will grow 102% compared to April’s 100% price level.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you think that in June the price level is going to drop 2%, you enter “-2” in the seasonal price change field. That will mean that price will drop down to 98% compared to April’s 100% price level.</p>

	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Normal waste”</b> is a loss of quantity of raw material, due to any reason; whether because of its nature of the material itself, the nature of the process, or some other conditions. For example, many materials contain water that tends to evaporate. That leads to reduction of material weight and quantity during the transporting, warehousing, or manufacturing process.</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using a widely proven formula to provide for normal waste loss in your calculations. This formula is used in many ERP systems, makes sense and is simple:</p>
		<p class="text-center ng-scope"><img src="/assets/formula1.png"></p>
		<p class="main__text">For example, you are making leather jackets. To manufacture 10 jackets you require 100 square feet of leather. You know that normal waste can reach 20%. Using the formula above, you get to know how much leather you need to purchase to be on the safe side with raw material quantity:</p>

	<div class="black__orange">	
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Cost of raw material beginning”</b> is the value of the particular raw material at the warehouse determined during inventory or according to your accounting reports, and is expressed in average purchasing prices of the previous periods. It does not have direct impact on the product cost.</p>
		<p class="main__text">It refers to the company's current inventory asset valuation and its value should be included in the <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) Schedule</b>. This <b>schedule</b> is a very helpful managerial tool. It reports and adjusts the total manufacturing costs for the accounting period (month, year) in the work‐in‐progress inventory account to calculate the cost of goods manufactured.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The amount of <b>COGM</b> is transferred to the finished goods inventory account during the accounting period and is used to calculate cost of goods sold on the <b>Income Statement Report</b>. When comparing the accounting of several <b>Income Statement Reports</b> over time, you can track changes of your gross profit volumes. This helps you set future goals and strategies for sales, inventory, and overhead.</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using the <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting method to compute the value of inventory. It means that the recorded amount of inventory represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased, manufactured, or sold. In other words, the cost valuation of the raw material in stock by the end of the month depends on its average monthly purchasing cost.</p>

		<p class="main__text">In the near future, we plan to create tools to allow the use of all or some quantities of the raw materials available at the beginning of the project to reduce the budgeted amount of material needed to be purchased during the first month of the project.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you are unsure what to enter for this value, avoid entering any values at this stage. Simply put “0” and press “Save” button.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you are just starting the manufacturing of a new product you probably will not have any values of the cost of raw material in the beginning for your projections because there was no business activity in the past.</p>
		<p class="main__text">All values must be free of taxes such as sales tax or VAT.</p>

	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Safety stock”</b> is a nice tool to keep your projected inventory investments on the economically reasonable level. Using the instant calculation option you can model the best-case scenario for raw material purchases.</p>

	<p class="main__text">This parameter does not have direct impact on the cost of the product but has a direct relation to the financial results of your project via section <b>“Direct materials purchased”</b> of the project’s <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured Schedule</b>. That is why you must avoid unnecessary stock purchases during your planning because that can impact your project’s financial results.</p>
	<p class="main__text">When you are done entering this amount, press the “Save” button. You can change a saved item by clicking on it. After the changes are done, press the “Update” button.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>Important note:</b> Be very careful while choosing the raw material’s measurement unit. When you have big quantity of different materials to be used during the production of one product, you must follow the common denominator of weights or sizes. If you start measuring the first material in liters, it makes no sense to skip to tons when measuring the second material.</p>
