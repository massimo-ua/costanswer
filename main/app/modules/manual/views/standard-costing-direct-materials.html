<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Direct materials</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify">Direct materials are the raw materials that become part of the product. For example flour, eggs, water and salt are the raw materials to make bread.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b><u>Data input</u></b></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Name of raw material”</b> is a text input field. There is a certain restriction on the length of the name. Please, try to be to be laconic in your statements. For the moment we do not provide raw material input forms with any additional technical information because do not see the necessity for the users to fill it in.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b> “Measurement unit”</b> is a text input field. Every raw material must be measured in certain units of length or weight.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Please, pay special attention to <b>“Standard quantity required”</b> input field. Depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>, this input field corresponds to the <b>standard volume</b> of raw materials required either for <b>“Standard quantity per batch”</b> approach:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.6.jpg"/p>
<p class="text-justify">or <b>“Standard quantity per month”</b> approach:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.4.jpg"/p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you know that you need 800 square feet of denim to manufacture a batch of 45 jeans. It’s a standard quantity of denim required and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch) of jeans. All together you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.2.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.5.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.6.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.7.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">On the other hand, if you choose <b>“per month”</b> approach you should know that in order to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month, you need 12000 square feet of denim. It’s a standard quantity of denim required. And it takes a month to make that number of jeans:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.8.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.5.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.9.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.1.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at entering-the-data stage corresponding to the <b>standard volume</b> of purchased and assigned raw materials.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of particular raw material entered using <b>“per batch”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard quantity required per each month of the annual budget of raw materials of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.2.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of particular raw material entered using <b>“per month”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard quantity required for the rest of 11 months of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 15.3.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">As you can see on the screenshots the standard quantity of denim mathematically is the same per each month of the annual budget of raw materials however the example was based upon two different approaches. It’s just a matter of your convenience and your costing methodology.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of the raw materials used during product’s production has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Price per unit”</b> input field corresponds to the current average purchasing price during the first month of the project. In other words you are setting the 100% price level at the start of the project.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The purchasing cost of the raw material used during product’s production has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Price values must be free of taxes as sales tax or VAT.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Season price change”</b> input form helps you to model price changes expressed in percent – rise or decline - during the year. In case you forecast the drop of the purchasing price you must enter the value with negative sign “minus”.</p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, April is the first month of your project. Its purchasing price is 100%. If you project 2% price growth in May, you enter the input field with “2”. That will mean that price will grow 102% compared to April’s 100% price level.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you think that in June price level is going to drop 2% down, you enter the input field with “-2” value. That will mean that price will drop down to 98% compared to April’s 100% price level.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Normal waste”</b> is a loss of quantities of raw material due to any reason either because of its nature of the material itself, the nature of the process or some other conditions. For example, many materials contain water that tends to vapor. That leads to reduction of material weight and quantity during the transportation, warehousing or manufacturing process.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using a widely proven formula to provide for normal waste losses in your calculations. This formula is used in many ERP systems and is logically correct and simple:</p> 
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/clip_image002.png"></p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you are making leather jackets. To manufacture 10 jackets you require 100 square feet of leather. You know that normal waste can reach 20%. Using the formula above, you get to know how much leather you need to purchase to be on the safe side with raw material quantity:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/clip_image004.png"></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Cost of raw material beginning”</b> is the value of the particular raw material at the warehouse determined during inventory or according to your accounting reports and expressed in average purchasing prices of the previous periods. It does not have direct impact on the product cost.</p>
<p class="text-justify">It refers to company's current inventory assets valuation and its value should be included in the <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) Schedule.</b> This <b>schedule</b> is a very helpful managerial tool. It reports and adjusts the total manufacturing costs for the accounting period (month, year) in the work-in-process inventory account to calculate the cost of goods manufactured.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of <b>COGM</b> is transferred to the finished goods inventory account during the accounting period and is used to calculate cost of goods sold on the <b>Income Statement Report</b>. When comparing the accounting of several <b>Income Statement Reports</b> over time, you can track changes of your gross profit volumes. This helps you set future goals and strategies for sales, inventory and overhead.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting method to compute the value of inventory. It means that the recorded amount of inventory represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased, manufactured or sold. In other words, the cost valuation of the raw material in stock by the end of the month depends on its average monthly purchasing cost.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Copy of 18.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">In the nearest future we plan to create some tools to allow users to use all or some quantities of raw materials available at the beginning of the project to reduce the budgeted volume of material needed to be purchased during the first month of the project.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you have doubts and hesitations regarding this value the best case scenario is to avoid entering any values at this stage. Simply put “0” and press “Save” button.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you start manufacturing of the new product you, probably, will not have any values of the cost of raw material beginning in your projections because there was no business activity in the past.</p>
<p class="text-justify">All values must be free of taxes as sales tax or VAT.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b> “Safety stock”</b> is a nice tool to keep your projected inventory investments on the economically reasonable level. Using instant calculation option you can model the best case scenario for raw material purchases.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/15.jpg"</p>
<p class="text-justify">This parameter does not have direct impact on the cost of the product but has a direct relation to the financial results of your project via section <b>“Direct materials purchased”</b> of the project’s <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured Schedule.</b> That is why, please, avoid unnecessary stock purchases during your planning because that can impact your project’s financial results.</p>
<p class="text-justify">When you are done with text and values, please, press button “Save”.</p>
<p class="text-justify">You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it and, after the changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note:</b> please, be very careful while choosing raw material’s measurement unit. In case you have big quantity of different materials to be used during the production of one product you must follow the common denominator of weights or sizes. If you start measuring first material in liters it makes no sense to skip to tons measuring the second material.</p>
