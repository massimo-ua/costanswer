<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Variable manufacturing overhead</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify">Manufacturing overhead can be broken into 2 types –<b>fixed manufacturing overhead (FMOH) </b>and<b> variable manufacturing overhead (VMOH).</b></p>
<p class="text-justify">Fixed manufacturing overhead costs incur every accounting period regardless of product quantities you manufacture.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Variable manufacturing overhead</b> strictly depends on the number of units produced and reflects some costs that can be entirely assigned to the total batch of product or service – for example the cost of batch transportation, batch packaging, batch shipment cost, batch lubricants, batch electricity or water cost, or, for example, some outsourced service or cost.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b><u>Data input</u></b></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Name of overhead” - </b>is a text input field. There is a certain restriction on the length of the name. Please, try to be to be laconic in your statements.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Standard cost”</b> - depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>, this input field corresponds to the <b>standard currency amount</b> of VMOH required either for <b>“Standard quantity per batch”</b> approach:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.1.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">or <b>“Standard quantity per month”</b> approach:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.2.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you made certain measurements and investigated that the cost of machinery electricity to manufacture a batch of 45 pairs of jeans of XL size is $100. It’s a standard currency amount for that quantity of jeans and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch) ready. All together you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.5.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.1.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.3.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">On the other hand, if you choose <b>“per month”</b> approach you should know that in order to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month, you need to spend $1500 for machinery electricity. It’s a standard currency amount of VMOH required. And it takes a month to make that number of jeans:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.8.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.5.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.2.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.4.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at entering-the-data stage corresponding to the <b>standard currency amount</b> of assigned VMOH.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of particular VMOH entered using <b>“per batch”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard currency amount required per each month of the annual budget of VMOH of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.5.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of particular VMOH entered using <b>“per month”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard currency amount required for the rest of 11 months of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.6.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">As you can see on the screenshots the standard currency amount mathematically is the same per each month of the annual budget of VMOH however the example was based upon two different approaches. It’s just a matter of your convenience and your costing methodology.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The currency amount of variable manufacturing overhead has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
<p class="text-justify">All values must be free of taxes as sales tax or VAT.</p>

<p class="text-justify">You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it and, after changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note:</b> please, keep in mind, that variable manufacturing overhead costs strictly depend on the level of production you are generating.</p>
