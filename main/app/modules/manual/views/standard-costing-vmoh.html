	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text">Manufacturing overhead can be broken into 2 types – <b>fixed manufacturing overhead (FMOH)</b> and <b>variable manufacturing overhead (VMOH)</b>.</p>
		<p class="main__text">Fixed manufacturing overhead costs incur every accounting period regardless of product quantities you manufacture.</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>Variable manufacturing overhead</b> strictly depends on the number of units produced and reflects some costs that can be entirely assigned to the total batch of product or service. Examples of these include things directly assigned to the batch are batch transportation, packaging, shipment cost, lubricants, may be some gas, electricity or water cost, or some outsourced service or cost.</p>

		<p class="main__text"><b>“Name of variable overhead”</b> is a text field. There is a restriction on the length of the field; please be brief.</p>

	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Standard cost”</b> - depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>, this field corresponds to the <b>standard currency amount</b> of VMOH required either for the <b>“Standard quantity per batch”</b> approach.</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">For example, you made certain measurements and investigated that the cost of the machine’s electricity to manufacture a batch of 45 pairs of jeans of XL size is $100. It’s a standard currency amount for that quantity of jeans and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch). In total, you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year.</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">On the other hand, if you choose the <b>“per month”</b> approach you should know that to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month, you need to spend $1,500 for the machine’s electricity. It’s a standard currency amount of VMOH required, and it takes a month to make that number of jeans.</p>

		<p class="main__text">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at the entering-the-data stage, corresponding to the <b>standard currency amount</b> of assigned VMOH.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The amount of the particular VMOH entered using the <b>“per batch”</b> approach will be automatically converted into the standard currency amount of VMOH required for each month of the annual budget of VMOH of your project corresponding to the product’s  monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>

	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">The amount of the particular VMOH entered using the <b>“per month”</b> approach will be automatically converted into the standard currency amount of VMOH required for the remaining 11 months of your project corresponding to the product’s monthly production plan quantities you have entered before.</p>
		<p class="screen-tit">Screen 12</p>
		<img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.6.jpg" alt="" class="main__img"/>
		<p class="main__text">As you can see on the screenshots the standard currency amount mathematically is the same for each month of the annual budget of VMOH; however, the example was based upon two different approaches. It’s just a matter of choice and your cost methodology.</p>

	<p class="main__text _margin_cor">The currency amount of variable manufacturing overhead has a crucial direct impact on the product cost and is very important for project calculations.</p>
	<p class="main__text">All values must be free of taxes such as sales tax or VAT.</p>
	<p class="main__text">When you are done entering this amount, press the “Save” button.</p>
	<p class="main__text">You can change a saved item by clicking on it. After the changes are done, press the “Update” button.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>Important note:</b> Keep in mind that the variable manufacturing overhead cost strictly depends on the level of production you are generating.</p>
