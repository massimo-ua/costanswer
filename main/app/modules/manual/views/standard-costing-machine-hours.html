	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text">Machine hour rate has <b>NO</b> impact on the product cost. It is the cost of running a machine per hour.</p>
		<p class="main__text">It’s one of the methods of calculating fixed manufacturing overhead absorption rate, where the number of hours the machines are expected to work is divided into the budgeted fixed manufacturing overhead to give it a so-called “predetermined overhead” rate per hour.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The hourly rate calculation is complicated and is based on a thoroughly investigated manufacturing process of a company that uses a lot of different machines. It includes the purchasing cost of the machine, the cost of installation of the machine, scrap value, useful life of the machine in hours, charges like rent allocated to the machine, repairs and maintenance of the machine, power consumption, setup time, cost of lubricants applied to the machine, and insurance for the machine.</p>
		<p class="main__text">Usually small and medium businesses do not use this kind of predetermined rate to apportion fixed manufacturing overhead, but <b>COSTANSWER</b> keeps this option available to our users.</p>
		<h4 class="main__title__lsub">Data entry fields:</h4>
		<p class="main__text"><b> “Standard quantity required”</b> is the <b>standard quantity</b> of machine hours per product’s batch. Depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>, this field is the standard volume of machine hours required either for <b>“Standard quantity per batch”</b> approach or <b>“Standard quantity per month”</b> approach.</p>
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">For example, you know that you need 5 machine hours to manufacture a batch of 45 jeans of XL size. It’s a standard quantity of hours required and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch) of jeans. In total, you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year.</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">On the other hand, if you choose <b>“per month”</b> approach you should know that to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month, you need 75 machine hours. It’s a standard quantity of machine hours required. And it takes a month to make that number of jeans.</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at the entering-the-data stage, corresponding to the <b>standard quantity</b> of machine hours.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">The number of machine hours entered using <b>“per batch”</b> approach will be automatically converted into the standard quantity of hours required for each month of the annual budget of machine hours of your project corresponding to the product’s monthly production plan quantities you have entered before.</p>

	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">The number of machine hours entered using <b>“per month”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard quantity of hours required for the remaining 11 months of your project corresponding to the product’s monthly production plan quantities you have entered before.</p>

		<p class="main__text">As you can see on the screenshots, the standard quantity of machine hours mathematically is the same for each month of the annual budget of machine hours; however, the example was based upon two different approaches. It’s just a matter of \choice and your cost methodology.</p>
	</div>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>“Hourly rate”</b> field is the average machine hourly rate during the first month of the project. This value has NO impact on the product cost and for now is only used for reference purposes.</p>
	<p class="main__text">When you are done entering this amount, press the “Save” button. You can change a saved item by clicking on it. After the changes are done, press the “Update” button.</p>
	<p class="main__text _margin_cor"><b>Important note:</b> Keep in mind, that for now only the quantity of machine hours is used as the method of calculating fixed manufacturing overhead absorption rate (allocation base) by <b>COSTANSWER</b>.</p>
