<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Machine hours</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify">Machine hour rate has <b>NO</b> impact on the product cost. It is the cost of running a machine per hour.</p>
<p class="text-justify">It’s one of the methods of calculating fixed manufacturing overhead absorption rate, where the number of hours the machines are expected to work is divided into the budgeted fixed manufacturing overhead to give a so called “predetermined overhead” rate per hour.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The hourly rate calculation is pretty complicated and is based on thoroughly investigated the manufacturing process of the company that uses a lot of different machineries. It includes the purchasing cost of the machine, the cost of installation of the machine, scrap value, useful life of the machine in hours, charges like rent allocated to the machine, repairs and maintenance of the machine, power consumption, setup time, cost of lubricants applied to the machine and insurance of the machine.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Usually small and medium businesses do not use this kind of predetermined rate to apportion fixed manufacturing overhead. But <b>COSTANSWER</b> preserves this option available to our users.</p>
<p><b><u>Data input</u></b></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Standard quantity required”</b> is the <b>standard quantity</b> of machine hours per product’s batch. Depending on the <b>standard quantity</b> approach you chose in <b>“Product/Service settings”</b>, this input field corresponds to the <b>standard volume</b> of machine hours required either for <b>“Standard quantity per batch”</b> approach or <b>“Standard quantity per month”</b> approach.</p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you know that you need 5 machine hours to manufacture a batch of 45 jeans of XL size. It’s a standard quantity of hours required and it takes 2 days to make that quantity (batch) of jeans. All together you plan to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the year:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.7.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">On the other hand, if you choose <b>“per month”</b> approach you should know that in order to manufacture 675 pairs of jоeans during the first month, you need 75 machine hours. It’s a standard quantity of machine hours required. And it takes a month to make that number of jeans:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.8.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 14.5.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.8.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">In both cases it means that your product can be evaluated as a <b>standard quantity</b> of units (per batch or per month) at entering-the-data stage corresponding to the <b>standard quantity</b> of machine hours.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The number of machine hours entered using <b>“per batch”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard quantity required per each month of the annual budget of machine hours of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 16.9.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">The number of machine hours entered using <b>“per month”</b> approach will be automatically converted into standard quantity required for the rest of 11 months of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities you have entered before:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/Screenshot 17.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">As you can see on the screenshots the standard quantity of machine hours mathematically is the same per each month of the annual budget of machine hours however the example was based upon two different approaches. It’s just a matter of your convenience and your costing methodology.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>“Hourly rate”</b> input field corresponds to the average machine hourly rate during the first month of the project. This value has NO impact on the product cost and for the moment is used only in reference purposes.</p>
<p class="text-justify">When you are done with values, please, press button “Save”.</p>
<p class="text-justify">You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it and, after the changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note: </b>please, keep in mind, that for the moment only the quantity of machine hours is used by <b>COSTANSWER</b> as the method of calculating fixed manufacturing overhead absorption rate (allocation base).</p>
