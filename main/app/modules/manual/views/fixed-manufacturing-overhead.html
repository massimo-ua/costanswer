<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> uses 2 approaches to apply fixed manufacturing overhead (FMOH) – <b>“full cost applied”</b> and <b>“predetermined overhead rate”</b>. What is the difference? We have divided data entry of FMOH into 8 groups – indirect labor, indirect materials, rent, depreciation and others. If you know the exact values of these 8 groups in coming months, you can enter them using <b>“full cost applied”</b> button.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/10.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">If you do not know the exact cost of FMOH, you can use <b>“predetermined overhead rates”</b> button to calculate <b>the approximate (!)</b> number of indirect costs per each product or service in your product mix. </p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/11.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">What allocation base is yours? It really depends upon your type of business. If your business requires a lot of manual work and you hire many workers – probably you can choose “Labor hours” or “Direct labor” option. If your company has a lot of machinery used during the manufacturing process – maybe you can use “Machine hours” option. If your production consumes a lot of raw materials you might choose “Direct materials” option. Also, you can ask your accountant what allocation base is used in your ERP or accounting program (QuickBooks, Sage, SAP and others).</p> 
<p class="text-left"><u><b>Data input</b></u></p>
<p class="text-justify">FMOH settings require both manual input of percentage rate and choosing the value you need from the dropping list options.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you cannot make decisions about allocation base – you can choose “Prime cost” option. Prime cost is the cost of direct materials used and direct labor applied during the manufacturing process. The cost of 2 key elements of product cost allows to distribute overheads more evenly.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note:</b> please, keep in mind, that fixed manufacturing overhead costs occur no matter what level of production or sales you are generating. That is why these expenses must be paid out of the company's cash, regardless of volume of sales.</p>
<p class="text-center"><b>Indirect materials</b></p>
<p class="text-justify">Indirect materials are part of FMOH and are the materials that are used in a production process, but are not directly traceable to a cost object. Sometimes these materials are not monetarily significant or not conveniently traceable. For example many companies use different types of lubricants for their machinery or restaurants use different spices during the production of different sauces or dishes.</p>
<p class="text-justify">But often indirect materials cost pretty significant for the business - for example, different tools, measurement instruments and devices, transportation vehicles, loading equipment, cleaning supplies and etc.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u><b>Data input</b></u></p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER</b> helps you to trace every kind of such indirect materials. </p>
<p class="text-justify">The cost amount you are putting in must reflect the average expected monthly cost of  indirect material. Cost values must be free of taxes as sales tax or VAT.</p>
