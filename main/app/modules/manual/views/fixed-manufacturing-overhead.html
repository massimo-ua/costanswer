	<p class="main__text"><b>COSTANSWER</b> uses 2 approaches to apply fixed manufacturing overhead (FMOH) – <b>“full cost applied”</b> and <b>“predetermined overhead rate”</b>. What is the difference? We have divided data entry of FMOH into 8 groups – indirect labor, indirect materials, rent, depreciation and others. If you know the exact values of these 8 groups in the coming months, you can enter them using <b>“full cost applied”</b> button.</p>

			<p class="main__text">What is your allocation base? It really depends upon your type of business. If your business requires a lot of manual labor and you hire many worker, probably you can probably choose “Labor hours” or “Direct labor” option. If your company has a lot of machinery used during the manufacturing process, perhaps you can use “Machine hours” option. If your production consumes a lot of raw materials you might choose “Direct materials” option. Also, you can ask your accountant what allocation base is used in your ERP or accounting program (QuickBooks, Sage, SAP and others).</p> 
			<p class="main__text">FMOH settings require both manual input of percentage rate and choosing the value you need from the drop-down list of options.</p>
			<p class="main__text">If you cannot decide the allocation base, you can choose the “Prime cost” option. Prime cost is the cost of direct materials used and direct labor applied during the manufacturing process. The cost of 2 key elements of the product cost allows for the distribution of overhead more evenly.</p>
			<p class="main__text"><b>Important note:</b> Keep in mind, that fixed manufacturing overhead costs occur no matter what level of production or sales you are generating. That is why these expenses must be paid out of the company's cash, regardless of volume of sales.</p>
