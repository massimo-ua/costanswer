<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>WIP beginning inventory</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify">WIP (work-in-proсess) <b>beginning</b> (it was <b>ending</b> at the end of the previous period) inventory is the sum of all costs put into the production process to manufacture products that are partially completed at the beginning of the accounting period (month). It can be expressed both in currency value and quantity.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you have some partially completed products at the beginning of the forecasted period you have to somehow define its quantity and find their average value in an unfinished condition.</p>
<p class="text-justify">WIP beginning has a direct impact on the product cost under the standard costing method in accordance with the formula shown below:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/clip_image002.png"></p>
<p class="text-justify">where:</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>DM $</b> - is the cost of direct materials assigned</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>DL $</b> - is the cost of direct labor applied</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>VMOH $</b> - is the cost of variable manufacturing overhead applied</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>FMOH $</b> - is the cost of fixed manufacturing overhead apportioned</p>
<p class="text-justify">Usually, WIP at the beginning of the month has the same standard currency value and quantity as WIP at the end of the month. However, if you start the production of a new product, the number of partially completed products at the end of the first forecasted months can be higher than at the end of the forecasted year due to the lack of personnel experience and competency, higher purchasing cost of direct materials and smaller output and sales of the finished goods manufactured.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Also, WIP beginning refers to the company's current inventory assets valuation and its value is included in the <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) schedule.</b> This <b>schedule</b> is a very helpful managerial tool. It reports and adjusts the total manufacturing costs for the accounting period (month, year) in the work-in-process inventory account to calculate the cost of goods manufactured.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of <b>COGM</b> is transferred to the <b>finished goods inventory account</b> during the accounting period and is used to calculate the cost of goods sold on the <b>Income Statement Report</b>. When comparing the accounting of several <b>Income Statement Reports</b> over time, you can track changes of your gross profit volumes. This helps you set future goals and strategies for sales, inventory and overhead:</p>

<p class="text-justify">Here is a simple example to understand the importance of inventory valuation – you have purchased 1000 sq. feet of denim to produce jeans, store it and start accounting it for the value of the raw materials. After you pulled it for production of some pairs of jeans, it’s no longer accounted for within materials inventory. Once your jeans are finished, they are accounted for in the value of finished product inventory. During the interim, jeans are valued and accounted separately as the work in process (beginning or ending). It means that every raw material is an asset and must be valued and accounted for during all stages of transformation into the finished product during the production cycle.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>COSTANSWER </b> is using <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting method to compute the value of inventory. It means that the recorded amount of inventory represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased, manufactured or sold.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you have doubts and hesitations regarding WIP beginning values you can consult your accountant or simply avoid entering any data at this stage, put “0” and press “Save” button.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Return to this bookmark when you finish entering other values of the product and see the final costs per unit and per batch. Then you can start entering different values of WIP beginning inventory to understand its impact on COGM.</p>
<p class="text-justify">There are many different methods of WIP beginning (ending) inventory calculations. Some of them are based on subjective visual estimate. Some require usage of special measurement devices or even laboratory analysis.</p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you can use the simple and proved method of equivalent units calculation. Assume that you plan to manufacture 200 wooden chairs during the first month, and you have 30 chairs left in an unfinished condition at the beginning of the current month. Your subjective estimate is that these chairs are 70 percent complete. 30 chairs multiplied by 70 percent equals 21 equivalent units. Add that to the 200 completed units to determine your total equivalent units produced:</p>
<p class="text-justify">200 + 21 = 221.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Divide the cost per batch for the period by the total number of equivalent units produced to determine your cost per unit. For example, according to product costing report, the batch cost of 200 fully completed chairs during the first month is 10000 dollars. The cost per equivalent unit will be:</p>
<p class="text-justify">10000 / 221 = 45,25 dollars.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Multiply the cost per unit by the equivalent units sitting in work-in-process inventory at the beginning of the period to calculate the value of WIP beginning inventory:</p>
<p class="text-justify">45,25 x 21 = 950,23 dollars</p>
<p class="text-justify">The good news is that NOT ALL products can be partially completed. For example, in the food processing industry or in restaurant business it is hardly possible to imagine a pot of soup in unfinished condition at the beginning of the month. Also, many businesses with rapid production of goods usually do not track WIP beginning (ending) inventory.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you start manufacturing of a new product you also will not have WIP beginning inventory in your projections because there was no business activity in the past.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b><u>Data input</u></b></p>
<p class="text-justify">Please, enter both the currency value and quantity of WIP beginning inventory at the beginning of the first month of the project:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/51.jpg"></p>
<p class="text-justify">When you are done with value, please, press button “Save”.</p>
<p class="text-justify">You can introduce changes to saved element simply by clicking on it and, after the changes are done, press button “Update”.</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note:</b> please, keep in mind, that service is intangible, so it cannot be stored. That is why it is impossible to have its WIP inventory value at the beginning (ending) of the accounting period.</p>
