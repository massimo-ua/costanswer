	<div class="black__orange">
		<p class="main__text">WIP (work-in-proсess) <b>starting</b> (it was <b>finishing</b> at the end of the previous period) inventory is the sum of all the costs put into the production process to manufacture products that are partially completed at the beginning of the accounting period (month).</p>
		<p class="main__text">This amount has a direct impact on the product cost under the COSTANSWER standard cost method. Also it refers to company's current inventory asset valuation and its amount should be included in the <b>Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) schedule</b>. This <b>schedule</b> is a very helpful managerial tool. It reports and adjusts the total manufacturing costs for the accounting period (month, year) in the work‐in‐process inventory account to calculate the cost of goods manufactured.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The amount of <b>COGM</b> is transferred to the finished goods inventory account during the accounting period and is used to calculate cost of goods sold on the <b>Income Statement Report</b>. When comparing the accounting of several <b>Income Statement Reports</b> over time, you can track changes of your gross profit volumes. This helps you set future goals and strategies for sales, inventory and overhead.</p>

		<p class="main__text _margin_cor">Here is a simple example to understand the importance of inventory valuation. You have purchased 1,000 square feet of denim to produce jeans, store it and start accounting it for the value of the raw materials. After you pulled it for production of some jeans, it’s no longer accounted for within materials inventory. Once your jeans are finished, they are accounted for in the value of finished product inventory. During the interim, jeans are valued and accounted separately as the work-in-process (beginning or ending). The conclusion is this: every raw material is an asset and must be valued and accounted for during all stages of transformation into finished product during production cycle.</p>
		<p class="main__text"><b>COSTANSWER</b> is using <b>Weighted Average Periodic Inventory</b> accounting method to compute the value of inventory. This means that the recorded amount of inventory represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased, manufactured or sold.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you have some partially completed products at the beginning of the accounting period you have to somehow find their average value in an unfinished condition.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you are unsure what to enter you can consult your accountant or enter “0” and press the “Save” button.</p>
		<p class="main__text">Return to this section when you finish entering other values for the product to see the final costs per unit and per batch. Then you can start entering different values of WIP beginning inventory to understand its impact on the product cost.</p>
		<p class="main__text">The good news is that NOT ALL products can be partially completed. For example, in the food industry or in restaurant business it is hardly possible to imagine a pot of soup in unfinished condition at the beginning of the month. Also, many businesses with rapid production of goods usually do not track WIP beginning (ending) inventory.</p>
		<p class="main__text">If you start the manufacturing of a new product you also will not have WIP beginning inventory in your projections because there was no business activity in the past.</p>

	<p class="main__text">Please, enter the currency value of WIP beginning inventory at the beginning of the first month of the project.</p>
	<p class="main__text">When you are done entering this amount, press “Save” button.</p>
