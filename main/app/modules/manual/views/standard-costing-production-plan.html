<p><h3 class="text-center"><u><b>Production plan</b></u></h3></p>
<p class="text-justify">This element reflects the volume of the finished goods to be produced or the services to be delivered during each accounting period. These values have direct impact on the product cost and are very important for project calculations.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The first month of the production plan automatically becomes the <b>standard</b> quantity of the finished goods that require the <b>standard</b> quantity of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead to be applied to the finished product.</p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, in order to manufacture 675 pairs of jeans during the first month of the production plan, you need to use 12000 square feet of denim. It’s a standard quantity of denim required to manufacture that quantity of jeans.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The amount of particular raw material (direct labor, overhead) entered to match the standard quantity of the finished goods for the first month of your project will be automatically converted into standard quantity of direct materials, direct labor and overhead required for the next 11 months of your project corresponding to the monthly production plan quantities.</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you start the production of the new product, the number of the finished goods during the first forecasted months can be lower than the numbers at the end of the forecasted year due to the lack of personnel experience and competency, higher purchasing cost of direct materials and smaller sales of the finished goods manufactured.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Also, there might be a situation that your production plan per certain month will not correspond to the automatically calculated quantity of the finished goods manufactured. That can happen because of WIP beginning (ending) influence under the formula shown below:</p>
<p class="text-justify"><b>Finished goods manufactured = WIP beginning Units + Production plan Units – WIP ending Units</b></p>
<p class="text-justify">For example, you planned to produce 220 wooden chairs during July but the real quantity of the finished goods manufactured has reached 225 units because 30 chairs were left in WIP beginning inventory at the beginning of the month and 25 chairs were left in WIP ending inventory at the end of the month.</p>

<p class="text-justify"><b>Important note: </b> please, keep in mind, that during your production output forecast you have to take into account the volume of the finished goods already available in the warehouse inventory at the beginning of each accounting period.</p>
